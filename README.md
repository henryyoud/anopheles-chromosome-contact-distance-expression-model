# Anopheles Chorosome Contact Distance Expression Model

These R scripts model the impact of 3D chromosomal contact and linear genomic distance on gene expression.

Linear genomic distance and gene annotation were computed using the file "Anopheles-gambiae-PEST_BASEFEATURES_AgamP4.7.gff3.gz" taken from VectorBase.

Chromosome contact data were extracted using Hi-C data taken from Lukyanchikova et al. (2022).
